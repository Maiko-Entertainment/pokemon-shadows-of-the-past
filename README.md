# Pokemon Shadows of the Past
This is a fanmade project made in my free time. I wanted to recreate the pokemon mechanics without using RPG Maker.
## Features
- Catch pokemon, level them up.
- Evolve pokemon (By using items, friendship or level up)
- Pokemon learn new moves.
- 1v1 battle system.
- Battle trainers
- Shadow Pokemon (They are stronger but sometimes won't obey you)
- Pokemon status (poisoned, paralyzed, confused, etc)
- Pokedex
- Animated sprites.
- Dialog system with cutscenes.
- Pokemon follow you.
- Wild pokemon appear in the over world.
